  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all five requirements (REQ-13 through REQ-17) for PDF upload and management. Backend includes PDF data structure with Blob storage, complete CRUD operations with admin-only access control, and migration support. Frontend implements comprehensive admin panel with file upload (PDF validation, 10MB limit), subject selection, and list view organized by subject. Public-facing PDFs page provides authenticated browsing with subject filtering, view/download capabilities, and proper authentication gates. React Query hooks follow existing patterns with proper cache invalidation and loading states.",
